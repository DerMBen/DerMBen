Hi, I'm Ben!

* üé® I'm a graphics design student from Austria
* üí° I'm mainly interested in typography and frontend-development
* üß† I'm currently trying to learn JavaScript, as well as trying to keep my knowledge of typography fresh.
* ‚úç As of 2023-06, I'm fully AsciiDoc-pilled and am trying to cram it into every aspect of my workflow
** Now, I just need a way to use it to write content for InDesign
** Update 2024-02: I`'m writing everything I do in AsciiDoc by now (except for things where I can`'t, such as group projects).
+
I still have not found an efficient way to get my AsciiDoc files into InDesign, I might just have to learn theming footnote:[Using https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/html-backend/custom-stylesheet/[CSS for HTM]L output; And https://docs.asciidoctor.org/pdf-converter/latest/theme/create-theme/[YAML for PDF] output].
* My favourite VS Code extensions are https://github.com/stars/DerMBen/lists/fav-vs-code-extensions[here].
* https://github.com/ThePrimeagen[ThePrimeagen] has successfully convinced me that Vim is amazing, but learning it is something I don't think I could take the time for currently.
* In a similar vain, I`'m interested in trying alternative keyboard layouts -- I recently came across the German https://neo-layout.org/[Neo]-Layout, the easy access to special characters it offers seems great from both a coding, and typographical standpoint -- but that too takes time to https://neo-train.lamdera.app/[learn]/adjust to.

== Repositories

*The https://github.com/DerMBen/DerMBen[DerMBen/DerMBen] repo* is for things specific to me, such as:

* my profile-readme
* my boilerplates for HTML, CSS, etc.
